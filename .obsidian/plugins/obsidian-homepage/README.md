<p align="center">Open a specified note, canvas, or workspace upon launching <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>.</p>
<br>

* Use any note, canvas, or workspace as a homepage. Alternatively, choose a random note, or use your Daily or Periodic Notes.
* Decide what happens to old tabs that were left open - keep them, replace the last note, or remove them all.

<!---->
* Jump back after startup using the `Open homepage` command, or click the dedicated ribbon button.
* Open in in any view: Reading, Source, Live Preview, or the default. Optionally revert the view when opening another note.

<!---->
* Run any Obsidian command upon opening the homepage, allowing integration with hundreds of plugins. 
* Works effectively with tools such as [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to create advanced landing pages.
